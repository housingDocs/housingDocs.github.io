It is by no means a language, and is only capable of doing what housing does. There is no abstraction, what you write is what you get.\nHTSL's purpose is to make it easier for people to develop housings or just sharing code with other people. Having a standard to talk about Housing actions makes it much easier to discuss code as we don't have to use weird different forms of pseudocode unique to everyone."
