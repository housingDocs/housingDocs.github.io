<div class="page-title">Welcome to HTSL!</div>
<div class="page-subtitle">Housing Text Scripting Language, created by BusterBrown1218.</div>

<div class="page-content-text">HTSL (Housing Text Scripting Language) is both a scripting syntax and a ChatTriggers module designed to help users write, share, and import/export scripts directly within Housing using a macro. Its syntax mirrors Housing code, each line in HTSL corresponds directly to a Housing action, with no additional functionality beyond what Housing already provides.
<br><br>
The creator, BusterBrown1218, describes HTSL as follows:
<blockquote><i>HTSL is a direct one-to-one, line-to-Housing action script. It is by no means a language, and is only capable of doing what housing does. There is no abstraction, what you write is what you get.
HTSL's purpose is to make it easier for people to develop housings or just sharing code with other people. Having a standard to talk about Housing actions makes it much easier to discuss code as we don't have to use weird different forms of pseudocode unique to everyone.</i></blockquote></div>

<div class="page-content-text">
With Hypixel's latest update to their rules, macros for specifically importing/exporting Housing actions are now allowed, meaning you can safely use HTSL as you want without safe mode enabled.</div>

<div class="page-content-header">HTSL Installation</div>
<div class="page-content-list">
<div class="page-content-list-point">Go to the <a href="https://github.com/BusterBrown1218/HTSL/releases/latest">HTSL GitHub</a> releases page.</div>
<div class="page-content-list-point">Download the <span class="markdown-monospace">HTSL.zip</span>.</div>
<div class="page-content-list-point">Extract the zipped file into a new folder called <span class="markdown-monospace">HTSL</span> (make sure there is only one HTSL folder, not <span class="markdown-monospace">HTSL\HTSL\rest of files</span>).</div>
<div class="page-content-list-point">Now, in-game we're going to run <span class="markdown-monospace">/ct files</span>, and go into your modules folder and drop your HTSL folder right in there.</div>
<div class="page-content-list-point">Last thing left to do is <span class="markdown-monospace">/ct reload</span> and you can now use the HTSL module!</div></div></div>
