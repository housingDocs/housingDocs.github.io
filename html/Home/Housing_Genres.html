<div class="page-content-text">
<p>Housing is very diverse with many types of Houses created by different people ever since its introduction in 2015.<br>
Here are the following main categories (in alphabetical order):

<div class="page-content-header">Freebuild</div>
Freebuild is a genre dedicated to open-ended creativity. Players are given access to build permissions and a blank plot where they can construct, collaborate, and share their creations with others.<br><br>

Players can build anything from grand castles, skyscrapers, cities to complex Redstone devices, pixel art, or even mega projects, limited only by their imagination.<br><br>

To join a Freebuild in Hypixel Housing, follow these steps:<br>
1. Enter the Hypixel Housing lobby.
2. Click on the NPC labeled 'Browse Houses'.
3. In the browser menu, click on a channel's icon (e.g., Most cookies, Roleplay tag, Most guests).
4. Change the channel type to show houses with the 'Build' tag to find Freebuilds.<br><br>

If no Freebuilds are found, try using the 'Most Guests' tag or other channels to find active Freebuilds without the 'Build' tag.<br>
If you still can't find any, there might not be any active Freebuilds at that time, and you may need to check back later.<br><br>

Most Freebuilds may contain:<br><div class="page-content-list"><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">A lobby</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Welcome messages</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">A Housing+ enabled plot</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Customized scoreboard and ranks</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Item Blacklist</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Easy-to-understand rules</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Optional features for entertainment or security<br><br></div></div>

Each Freebuild has its own set of rules, and must comply with Housing rules. If any player breaks a rule, they would either be demoted within the Freebuild or be punished by Hypixel.<br><br>

Some Freebuilds may also have tiers for their builder ranks, to encourage players to create good builds.<br><br>

<div class="page-content-header">Hangout</div>
Hangout focused on social interaction between players. Guests gather in creatively designed environments to chat and make friends without specific gameplay objectives or competitive elements.<br><br>

Spaces can range from beautifully decorated gardens and cozy cafes to themed party zones, providing comfortable settings for conversation and community building.<br><br>

<div class="page-content-header">Minigames / Events</div>
Minigames / Events is a competition-based gamemode. Players participate in custom-designed games with specific objectives, rules, and win conditions, offering diverse challenges beyond build battle or parkour.<br><br>

Games can range from simple PvP arenas and spleef to complex creations like King of the Hill, mazes, and team-based challenges, providing quick, engaging sessions with clear goals and outcomes.<br><br>

Minigame Housings typically don’t stay open, but are hosted as part of events.<br><br>

Each Minigames house operates under its own specific rules while requiring compliance with general Housing rules. Cheating, team killing, or disrespectful behavior may result in disqualification.<br><br>

<div class="page-content-header">Parkour</div>
Parkour is a genre dedicated to precision. Players are given a series of jumps and obstacles they must complete in sequence, testing their Minecraft movement skills to reach the end goal.<br><br>

Courses can range from beginner-friendly jumps to highly complex “puzzles” involving neos (wall wraps), ladder or fence jumps, and other advanced techniques, providing a progressive challenge for all skill levels.<br><br>

Most Parkour houses contain:<br><div class="page-content-list"><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">A lobby with a start pad</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Feature to autosave your progress</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">A leaderboard for completion times</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Customized scoreboard and rewards</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">2-3 chances to skip a level<br><br></div></div>

Some Parkour houses may also feature extra courses, allowing players to train their skills further; and some may contain anticheats, preventing players from flying through the course using exploits.<br><br>

There are mainly 3 types of parkours:<br><div class="page-content-list"><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Regular Parkour</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">2-player Parkour, where teamwork is required</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Speedrun Parkour, where the jumps are usually made easy for players to beat the course in mere minutes<br><br></div></div>

<div class="page-content-header">PvP</div>
PvP (Player versus Player) is a genre designed for combat. Players engage in battles against each other using various weapons, game mechanics, and different strategies in custom-built arenas designed for fast-paced action and skillful gameplay.<br><br>

Battles can range from simple free-for-all duels to complex team-based matches with custom kits and different arena designs that encourage different fighting styles and tactics.<br><br>

Most PvP houses may contain:<br><div class="page-content-list"><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Custom arenas with varied terrain and cover</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Kit selection systems with different weapons</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Scoreboards tracking kills and wins</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Spectator areas<br><br></div></div>

<div class="page-content-header">Roleplay</div>
Roleplay, as the name suggests, focuses on collaborative storytelling. Players create characters, adopt roles, and interact within themed settings to create shared narratives and explore fictional scenarios together.<br><br>

Settings can range from realistic modern cities and fantasy kingdoms to specialized environments like schools, hospitals, or medieval villages, providing backdrops for players to develop characters, relationships, and storylines through in-character dialogue and actions.<br><br>

<div class="page-content-header">Simulator</div>
Simulator is based on repetitive progression. Players perform simple actions to earn in-game currency or points, which they can spend on upgrades, ranks, and cosmetics to advance faster and show off their progress.<br><br>

Gameplay typically involves clicking on items, breaking blocks, jumping, or completing simple tasks to earn resources, which can then be used to purchase upgrades that automate income or unlock new features and areas.<br><br>

Most Simulator houses may contain:<br><div class="page-content-list"><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">A starter area with basic instructions</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Clickable items or breakable blocks for earning currency</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Upgrade shops with ranks and boosts</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Prestige systems for resetting progress with bonuses</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Leaderboards tracking wealth or progress</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Automated income generators</div><div class="page-content-list-point" data-flag="">Cosmetic shops for visual customization</p></div></div>
